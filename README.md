## What is LogSleuth?

LogSleuth is an open-source (Apache-2.0) Android logging toolkit with two
halves that work together:

- **The viewer app** — a polished, Logcat-style live reader for the whole
  device, written in Kotlin + Jetpack Compose (Material 3). Shizuku, root,
  or one ADB grant unlocks the device log. Shizuku stays the recommended
  path when the phone is not rooted.
- **`logsleuth-sdk`** — a drop-in library for your own app that records its
  logs, crashes and ANRs **with zero permissions and zero network**, then
  packages them into a zip your users can send you. LogSleuth the viewer
  opens those zips directly.

## Feature overview

### Watch the stream

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Live logcat | `threadtime` rows with level colors, pid·tid·uid columns and per-app icons |
| Smooth tail-follow | Conveyor-style auto-scroll that tracks the arrival rate; a fling up detaches, a fling back re-pins |
| Pause & buffer | Freeze the display while lines keep buffering underneath — the banner counts what's waiting |
| Search | Query across the whole buffer: hit counter, highlighted matches, prev/next jumps |
| Jump controls | FABs to snap to the oldest buffered line or back to the live tail |
| Engine chip | Streaming / Connecting / Stopped / Error at a glance — with the real cause (e.g. `logcat exited 1`) shown when it fails; auto-reconnects with backoff |

### Narrow it down

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Filters | Level threshold (V–A), tag, keyword, exclude-pattern, regex toggle — combinable |
| Filter presets | Save a filter combo, reapply it later; presets manage their own screen |
| Per-app filter | Chip over the stream filters to one app (package names need the uid column, so Shizuku or root) |
| App picker | Installed-app list with icons and per-app line stats |

### Act on what you see

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Entry detail | Tap a row for the full message, pid/tid/uid, copy message or raw line |
| Multi-select | Long-press a row, tap to extend the range, copy the whole block |
| Clear / save by scope | Wipe or snapshot **everything**, or check the apps you want in a two-pane picker with per-app stats |
| Session snapshot | Save the current buffer as a session in one tap |

### Record & replay

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Background recording | Foreground service with a live line-count notification (Stop / Bookmark actions) |
| Quick Settings tile | "Record logs" tile shows the live count while active |
| Floating bubble | Optional overlay with record / bookmark / hide controls over other apps (needs the overlay permission) |
| Bookmarks | Timestamp "it happened NOW" during a recording — visible in the session's Bookmarks tab |
| Auto-stop limits | Configurable size cap (8–512 MB, default 64) and duration cap (0–24 h, default unlimited) |
| Pre-start backfill | A recording can include the lines buffered before you hit record |
| Session replay | Reopen any session — Logs / Crashes / Bookmarks tabs, same filters and search as the live stream |
| Manage sessions | Swipe-to-delete with Undo; every session can be shared again later |

### Crash & ANR detection

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Live detection | `FATAL EXCEPTION`, native `Fatal signal` and ANR signatures flagged while streaming or recording |
| In-app event list | Crashes grouped by app (icon, name, count). Search, sort, and open one app's stack, version, and the surrounding lines. Delete one app's crashes with Undo |
| Notifications | Save and notify are separate for Java crashes, native crashes, and ANRs. Each app can have its own channel, so muting one in system settings keeps the record. The alert shows the stack, copies it, and opens that crash |
| Surrounding logs | Up to 200 lines from the moment of the crash are stored beside it and included in the share zip |

### Reports, export & import

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Report wizard | Three steps: pick the misbehaving app → reproduce while LogSleuth records → share ZIP/TXT or keep it in Sessions. A crash in the target app is flagged automatically |
| Export | Sessions and the report share as `.txt` or `.zip` (the zip bundles device info) |
| Import | Open `.zip`/`.txt`/`.log` from a file manager or share sheet — LogSleuth renders it as a session (this is also how SDK exports arrive) |

### Quality-of-life

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Guided tour | A 17-step hands-on tour that drives the real UI — replay it anytime from Settings → About |
| Setup wizard | Shizuku, an opt-in root card, and a copyable ADB grant, re-checkable in place |
| Bilingual | English & 简体中文, plus an in-app language override |
| Themes & text | System / Light / Dark themes; Compact / Default / Comfortable log text sizes |
| In-app updates | GitHub Releases check, release notes, resumable APK download (pause/resume/cancel), one-tap install, version history |
| Tunable buffer | On-screen ring buffer from 1,000 to 200,000 entries (default 20,000). Optional cold start that follows only new lines; a reconnect still continues from the last line |
| Log rows | Optional full lines instead of an 8-line clamp. Search has a match-case toggle on the search bar |
| Sessions | Rename any session from the list or its detail screen |

### Embedded SDK (`logsleuth-sdk`)

For app developers — everything above, pointed at *your* app's process:

| Capability | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Zero requirements | No permissions, no network, no accounts — an app can always read its own logs |
| Capture | Own-process logcat thread, Java crash handler (chained to the previous one), main-thread ANR watchdog |
| Storage | Ring-buffered log files (default 3 × ≤2 MB), automatic rotation |
| Privacy | `addRedaction(Regex)` strips secrets from recorded logs |
| Callbacks | `Sleuth.onCrash { … }` — fires on next start by default, or immediately if you prefer |
| Sharing | `Sleuth.shareLogs(activity)` zips logs + device info + metadata and opens the system share sheet |

## Getting started

### 1. Install

Grab the APK from [Releases](https://github.com/shiaho777/LogSleuth/releases) and install it (Android 8.0+ / API 26, ~2.4 MB).

### 2. Grant log access

Since Android 4.1, apps cannot read other apps' logs — a platform rule that
applies to every logcat app. Any one of these grants is enough:

1. **Shizuku (recommended)** — no root, no PC needed on Android 11+ via
   Wireless Debugging. Install [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/), start it
   once, and authorize LogSleuth. This also unlocks per-app filtering.
2. **Root** — if the phone already runs Magisk, KernelSU, or APatch, turn
   root on in the setup wizard. LogSleuth does not exec `su` until you ask,
   so an unrooted phone never sees a grant dialog. Root reads the same full
   log as Shizuku, including per-app filtering. Auto mode still prefers
   Shizuku when both are available; Settings can put root first.
3. **ADB grant** — with a PC, run once. The permission stays until you uninstall:
   ```bash
   adb shell pm grant io.github.shiaho777.logsleuth.app android.permission.READ_LOGS
   ```
   On Android 13 and later this grant is not a background log source. Android
   only shows the approval dialog while LogSleuth is on screen, and a start
   from the background is refused and remembered for about a minute. An
   already-approved stream keeps running after you leave. Shizuku and root
   are not affected, including the boot crash watch.

The setup wizard walks you through these on first launch and can be reopened
any time from Settings → Log access → "Open setup guide".

### 3. Take the tour

On first run a 17-step coach-mark tour drives the real UI — it opens the
filter bar, pauses the stream, types a search query, and pops the scope
picker for you. Skip it or replay it later from Settings → About → "Replay
guided tour".

## Everyday workflows

- **"The app keeps crashing for a user"** → Report tab → pick the app →
  start recording → hand them the phone → Stop & share. Crashes inside the
  window are flagged and attached automatically.
- **"It's too noisy"** → unfold the filter bar, pick only Warn and Error (or
  any level set) and a tag or keyword — or filter by app (Shizuku or root).
  Save the combo as a preset.
- **"I need to mark when it happened"** → enable Floating controls (needs the
  overlay permission) or use the Quick Settings tile: record + bookmark
  without leaving the app under test.
- **"I got a log zip / txt"** → open it with LogSleuth or use Import on the
  Sessions tab — it lands as a replayable session.
- **"That line matters"** → tap its ℹ icon for the full message and copy
  buttons; long-press to multi-select and copy a whole block.

## Embedding the SDK

Add the module to your project (source module today; a Maven artifact is
planned after the public release):

```kotlin
// app/build.gradle.kts
implementation(project(":sdk"))
```

```kotlin
class MyApp : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        Sleuth.init(this)   // capture starts immediately — no permissions
    }
}

// Anywhere in your app — e.g. a "send logs" support button:
Sleuth.shareLogs(activity)   // opens the system share sheet with a zip
```

Configuration via `SleuthConfig.Builder`:

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tagFilter(String)` | `null` (all) | Record only lines whose tag contains it (plus all ERROR lines) |
| `maxFiles(Int)` | 3 | Ring-buffer file count, 1–20 |
| `maxFileBytes(Long)` | 2 MB | Rotate after this many bytes per file (min 64 KB) |
| `captureLogcat(Boolean)` | `true` | Set false to record crashes/ANRs only |
| `watchAnr(Boolean)` | `true` | Main-looper heartbeat ANR watchdog |
| `onCrashInvokedOnNextStart(Boolean)` | `true` | Deliver the crash callback on next init instead of at crash time |
| `addRedaction(Regex)` | — | Extra patterns stripped before writing to disk |

Full API:

```kotlin
Sleuth.init(context, SleuthConfig.Builder().tagFilter("net").build())
Sleuth.onCrash { report -> /* queue it — runs on next start by default */ }
Sleuth.log("Checkout", "order=42 placed")       // injected into the stream
Sleuth.logException("Checkout", throwable)
val files: List<File> = Sleuth.logFiles()       // raw ring-buffer files
Sleuth.shareLogs(activity)
```

The zip contains `device.txt` (manufacturer/model/Android version),
`meta.txt` and the log files — and LogSleuth the viewer opens it natively,
so your support flow is "send me the zip" → they open it → you replay it.

## Architecture

```text
LogcatSource (local READ_LOGS / Shizuku shell / root shell)
  → LogcatEngine (single owner of the logcat process, auto-reconnect)
      ├→ Stream UI (level colors, filters, search, pause/buffering)
      ├→ RecordingManager (foreground service → session files + Room)
      └→ CrashDetector (FATAL EXCEPTION / Fatal signal / ANR → events + notifications)

logsleuth-sdk (embedded in a host app — zero permissions, zero network):
  Sleuth.init → own-process logcat capture + crash handler + ANR watchdog
              → ring-buffered log files (with secret redaction)
              → one-tap zip share (opens in the viewer for replay)
```

## Permissions

Everything the app asks for, and why:

| Permission | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `READ_LOGS` | Device log when you use the ADB grant. On Android 13+ a new logcat starts only while LogSleuth is on screen. Shizuku and root read logs through a shell instead |
| `moe.shizuku…API_V23` | Talking to the Shizuku service |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` + `…_DATA_SYNC` | Keeping background recording alive |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | Recording status, crash/ANR alerts, auto-stop notices |
| `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` | Floating record/bookmark bubble — only if you enable it |
| `INTERNET` | Update checks against GitHub Releases only — no analytics, no ads |
| `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` | Installing downloaded APK updates |

The **SDK itself declares no permissions at all** — it only ever reads its
host app's own logs.
